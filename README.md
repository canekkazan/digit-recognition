# Digit Recognition



numbers_digital_labeled_28px.rar is the dataset prepared by me and mentioned as the custom dataset in the source code digit_recognition.ipynb

CNN is designed by me which it is successful on test data of The MNIST database, although it is not much on the custom test data prepared by me.
Restoration of the custom data must be considered for getting successful predictions on the custom data.
